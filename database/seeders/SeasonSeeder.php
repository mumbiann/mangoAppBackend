Allow pits to "weather" through the first rains so they retain moisture, then backfill with the excavated soil mixed with well-decomposed farmyard manure at a 3:1 soil:FYM ratio. Remove seedlings from polybags by tearing down the side, place the graft union at soil level, half-fill the pit, water to settle the root ball, then completely fill and form a shallow basin around the trunk to conserve moisture. Finally, apply a 5 cm layer of organic mulch (rice straw, wood chips) beneath each seedling to suppress weeds, moderate soil temperature, and feed soil biota.',
